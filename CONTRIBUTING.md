Pull requests are the life and soul of a open-source project. We love them, 
just like the way you do. 

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo.
2. Run the tests. Since this is used in production, its our duty to maintain
   the quality of the project. We merge pull requests that are passing the tests.
   Please understand that its very important.
3. If you are refactoring your code, please make sure its correctly documented. 
   Make sure you tag the issue (if any) when creating the pull request.
4. Test. Test and Test.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Once we receive the pull request, we will work as fast as we can to get back
to you with necessary information about the pull request. Our tests are usually 
done at the server at our HQ. The OS varies from Ubuntu to Mac to Windows.

Things that will be considered when accepting your pull request:

* Mention if the tests are passing. And if there are any issues, please mention them too.
  We can work together to improve that feature.
* Update the documentation, the surrounding one, examples elsewhere, guides,
  whatever is affected by your contribution
* Follow the existing style of the project
